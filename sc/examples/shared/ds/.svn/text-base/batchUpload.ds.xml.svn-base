<!-- DataSource to support the BatchUploader component
     NOTE: This is not the DataSource responsible for performing the batch update of verified
           records, it is an internal resource used to handle the initial upload of the client-
           side file. The only time you would ever want to change this DataSource is if you wanted 
           a hook into the upload process (for security reasons, for example).  See the 
           BatchUploader documentation in the SmartClient reference.
