Each client (or separate office, tenant) has a dedicated, isolated cloud PBX , with separate :
- exntensions (with PBX functions â€” followme, Forward, Voice/Video Mail, Blacklists etc..)
- VoiceMail boxes,
- Call parkign spaces, Park&Announce
- Auto-attendants/Virtual Offices,
- Page/Ring Groups,
- Queues,
- multiple Music-on-Hold classes on separate storage,
- Conferences
- Inbound/Outbound routing logic

All clients/offices share the same server and the same asterisk instance and managemed in one place.
With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration, and each client works with a customized virtual application instance. Using the same asterisk instance for all the clients is a real cost and resource saving solution.
Some more key features:
- supports custom scripting, i.e. assigning a dialplan contexts to Feture codes, which connects extensions with unlimited functionality of the asterisk dialplan.
- Call recording (full or by one-touch on demand recording while conversation).

Uppong receiving call, manager can activate inbound route with actions:
