Some description about this project functions:
=========================================================================================
Each client (or separate office, tenant) has a dedicated, isolated cloud PBX , with separate :
- exntensions (with PBX functions â€” followme, Forward, Voice/Video Mail, Blacklists etc..)
- VoiceMail boxes,
- Call parkign spaces, Park&Announce
- Auto-attendants/Virtual Offices,
- Page/Ring Groups,
- Queues,
- multiple Music-on-Hold classes on separate storage,
- Conferences
- Inbound/Outbound routing logic
- Email SMTP account to delivery Reports/Notifications/Alerts

All clients/offices share the same server and the same asterisk instance and managemed in one place.
With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration, and each client works with a customized virtual application instance. Using the same asterisk instance for all the clients is a real cost and resource saving solution.
